Feedbin Link Opener
===================

This is a Safari extension that allows you to open Feedbin links in a background tab.

The keyboard shortcut is `shift + v`.

Why?
----

Safari used to allow background tab creation using JavaScript but this is no longer possible as of Safari 10.

How Do I Install This?
---------------------------

I haven't sprung for an Apple Developer Account so I can't release this as a proper extension. I bet that Feedbin will release an official extension soon.

While it is possible to clone this repository and install the extension yourself, Safari will uninstall it at every relaunch until it's properly signed. Sorry.
